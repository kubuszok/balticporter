# Baltic Porter — working rules

Baltic Porter is a **framework for porting Java libraries to Scala 3**, not a program for porting
one library. libGDX is spearheading the effort because it surfaces the most issues per file — but
the target is every libGDX module already ported in sge, every Java library that became part of ssg,
and, once published as open source, whatever libraries other people point it at.

Everything below follows from that. If a decision would make the engine better at libGDX and worse
at the next library, it is the wrong decision.

---

## 1. Universal vs library-specific — the rule that governs every phase and plugin

When designing a phase, transform or plugin, decide first **which of three kinds it is**. Get this
wrong and the framework silently becomes a libGDX porter.

### (a) Universal — belongs in the engine, unparameterised

A fact about **Java and Scala**, true of every codebase. Java arrays are covariant and Scala's are
not. Java interface constants are `static` and inherited; Scala companions do not inherit. Java
allows unchecked conversion at a raw type; Scala does not.

These live in `core` / `frontend-spoon` / `scala-emit` with no configuration.

### (b) Reusable mechanism, per-library policy — belongs in the engine, PARAMETERISED

The **mechanics are the same** for every library; what differs is *which* attributes, types,
variables or references get modified, and whether the rule runs at all. These belong in the engine
**taking their differences as constructor parameters** — sets, maps, lambdas, whatever fits — so the
porting program instantiates them with the values for its library.

An empty/default parameter must make the phase a **no-op**, so "turned off" needs no code path.

Current examples:

| phase | mechanism (engine) | policy (library) |
|---|---|---|
| `ClassTableTransform(Map)` | re-point a reflective name lookup at an explicit table | which method → which table |
| `StaticForwarderTransform(List[Forwarder])` | a wrapper's statics are plain members of argument 1 | which wrapper, receiver, members |
| `Substitutions` | do not emit these types/methods; inject this Scala instead | which ones, and the replacement sources |

### (c) Genuinely library-specific — a SEPARATE, PLUGGED-IN RULE

If a customisation needs knowledge so specific that it could only ever apply to **one** library, it
is a separate rule that the porting program plugs in. It does not go in the engine at any level of
generality. In future it will be maintained by the repository that manages that library's porting
effort, not by this repository.

Turning a primitive into an opaque type is the canonical example: *which* `Int`s are really a GL
handle is knowledge about libGDX and nothing else.

### The balance

**Design every rule to be as reusable as possible.** Reach for (c) only after establishing that the
mechanism genuinely cannot be shared. Most things that look library-specific are a (b) with the
policy inlined — that is exactly the mistake `ReflectionToPortableTransform` made, hard-coding
`com.badlogic.gdx.utils.reflect.ClassReflection` and its member list inside `core`.

### Enforcing it

No file under `core/`, `frontend-spoon/` or `scala-emit/` may name a ported library **in code**:

```
grep -rn --include='*.scala' -E "badlogic|libgdx" core frontend-spoon scala-emit | grep -vE ":\s*(\*|//)"
```

Library names in **doc comments** are fine and wanted — the worked example that justifies a general
rule (`GL30Interceptor` witnessing the export diamond, `Array<? extends T>` witnessing array
covariance). They document; they must drive nothing.

## 2. Adding a library to the corpus

Until the framework is published and each library gets its own porter repository, new libraries are
added to the **corpus** (`corpus-tests/`). The procedure for each:

1. **Make it compile.** Every effort — this is where the engine's gaps surface.
2. **Test-compile it**, then port and run its tests. Compiling is not passing; see §3.
3. **Run the Auditor** (§4) over both the new specialisations and the shared code.

Each library added is expected to move engine rules from (c) toward (b) toward (a). A rule that
survives three libraries unchanged is probably universal; one that needs a new parameter per library
is correctly a (b); one that cannot be shared at all is a (c) and should be named as such.

---

## 3. Compiling is not the gate

The compile-error count is a **typer-only** measurement: dotty's `Phase.isRunnable` is
`!ctx.reporter.hasErrors`, so a single typer error skips `RefChecks` for the whole program. Missing
`override`, unimplemented members and variance violations are unmeasured until the count reaches 0 —
and then the number will RISE. That is the gate beginning to tell the truth, not a regression.

Worse, a green compile says nothing about behaviour. Four silent correctness defects were found in
libGDX core that all compiled cleanly — dropped `static { }` blocks, dropped `super(args)`, dropped
anonymous-class bodies (156 sites, every button silently doing nothing), and the typer blind spot
itself. Each would have shipped.

So:

- **Every translation path gets a check at the same time it gets a translation.** A check reporting
  zero is only as good as its coverage.
- **Walk the tree with `StandardTraversal`**, never a private recursion — two of those four defects
  were hand-rolled traversals that stopped one node short.
- **Prefer running ported tests over any number of further compile fixes.** Assertions are the only
  evidence of behaviour this project can have.
- **Read the emitted output**, not just the count, when confirming a fix.

---

## 4. The Auditor

An **adversarial reviewer** (`.claude/agents/porting-auditor.md`) that reads the engine and the
per-library specialisations looking for over-specificity, missed cases and shortcuts — rules that
happen to work on the corpus rather than being right.

It runs on the **Fable 5** model and is expensive, so it is **not** run on every change. It is run
**by the user, once a whole piece of work is delivered.** Do not launch it speculatively.

---

## 5. Measurement discipline

- Reproduce libGDX numbers with `bash scripts/gdx_measure.sh`; the migration prints four independent
  checks on every run (signature consistency, omissions, portability, substitutions removed).
- **Change one thing, then measure.** Two changes measured together cost a full cycle to untangle
  and tell you nothing about either.
- **Record what regressed and why**, in `LIBGDX-PORT-STATUS.md` under "Do NOT retry". A measured
  failure is a result; re-deriving it later is waste.
- State counts as `before->after` in the commit subject.

---

## 6. Scala 3 output constraints

- **Never cast to `scala.Nothing`.**
- Vararg spread is `args*`, never `: _*`.
- Emit **fully-qualified names, no imports**, for the structural phase — this deletes the whole
  import-decision bug class. Human-readable imports are a separate, optional beautification backend.
